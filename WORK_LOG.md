| April 5 |    9-10pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                   I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Nov 13  |  1:45-2:45am  | I reread through Mr. Blick's compressor and tried to base mine off of his Blick Compressor. Its not working at all. I tried to look through the slideshow to help me better understand whats going on, but I'm struggling... |
| Nov 13  | 10:00-10:40am |                                                                                                                                                    I added an int that record number of chars at the beginning of my binary. |
| Nov 13  |   1:15-1:30   |                                                                                                              I made it so each char was recorded as a 2 bit binary, and my compressions works with an about 25% compression. |
